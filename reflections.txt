What has been learned during the project;

  We have learned how to implement the MVC design pattern.
  We have learned about different designed patterns and their purposes.
  We have learned how the data is transferred and stored in a big scale application.
  
  We dislike that we are not able to initialize pages on demand and we dislike that our controllers need references to the MainFrame.
  
  We think that the hardest part of our project was to convert the JSON objects to the Java POJO classes and connecting to the cloud firebase.
  
  We wish that we were wise enough to see that we would need abstraction levels such as;
    a system for handling actions.
    a system for live feed data.
    a system for resetting the model.
    a system for initializing the model on demand rather than initializing at the beginning.
    a system for updating the design from a single file.
